# Scoreo

Scoreo is an AI-driven self-testing system built for focused, topic-specific practice.

You tell it exactly what you want to be tested on — subject, topic, difficulty, and number of questions — and Scoreo handles the rest end-to-end.

It generates fresh questions using AI, assembles them into a test (initially via Google Forms), and gives you a shareable test link to attempt **without seeing answers in advance**.

---

## Purpose

Scoreo is built for **honest evaluation**.

It eliminates:
- Random practice
- Repeated question banks
- Answer-peeking
- Noise and distraction

Each test is:
- Generated on demand
- Strictly limited to the requested topic
- Difficulty-aware
- Answer-hidden until completion

---

## Core Model

**Request → Test Generator**

- Powered by AI for question creation  
- Focused on single-topic mastery, not broad exams  

---

## Vision

At its simplest, Scoreo is a clean way to say:
> “Test me on *this* topic.”

At its full vision, Scoreo evolves into:
- A system that remembers your performance per topic
- Adapts future tests to your weaknesses
- Acts like a silent coach that measures, tracks, and improves understanding over time

## Status

🚧 Early stage  
This repository currently contains no production code.

⏸ **Paused**

Development is currently paused.  
This project is intentionally on hold while other priorities are executed.

Scoreo may be resumed in the future when focus returns to this problem space.
